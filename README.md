# Rebel - 2D Java Game Engine

<img src="project/logo.png" alt="isolated" width="250"/>

Rebel is a WIP Java Game Engine for making 2D games on Desktop. It provides an OpenGL Batch Renderer that can draw textures, shapes and text. Rebel is open-source under the MIT license, so join the fun and let's build together!

## Getting Started

Rebel is currently an IntelliJ IDEA project (.iml), which means you will have to download the source from GitHub and run the rebel.engine.Main class. Eventually I will bring Rebel to Gradle. Currently only the Windows LWJGL natives are added, which means you will have to use Windows for now, 
but along with Gradle support, this is one of the things I'm looking to fix.
